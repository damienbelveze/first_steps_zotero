# What is a reference manager

before reference managers exist, writers had to manualy manage their references in their manuscript. It was a very tedious and painful task (and error-prone!)

bibliographic management styling was something that used to be treated just before the milestones were reached. How many difficult nights were spent and lost in putting all references in the right place and in the right format. 

All of this now is 99% supported by this class of software named reference managers. There are several of them. Among the most popular : 

- [Refworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RefWorks) (owned by Clarivates through Proquest)  
- [Endnote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EndNote)(also Clarivate's property and neither free-to-use nor premium)  
- [Mendeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendeley) (owned by Elsevier, free-to-use) 
- and of course Zotero which is free-to-use but above all *free* [¹]

# Why you should install Zotero rather than another reference manager?

If you are member of a school or laboratory which has subscribed to a proprietary software (such as Refworks or Endnote), maybe you have access to one of them. Good for you! But how will you manage your references when you are no longer member of this team?

Don't worry, it is possible to export all your references from Refworks or Endnote and to import them into Zotero.
